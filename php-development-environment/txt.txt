Running as an arbitrary user

If you know the permissions of your directory are already set appropriately (such as running against an existing database, as described above) or you have need of running mysqld with a specific UID/GID, it is possible to invoke this image with --user set to any value (other than root/0) in order to achieve the desired access/configuration:

$ mkdir data
$ ls -lnd data
drwxr-xr-x 2 1000 1000 4096 Aug 27 15:54 data
$ docker run -v "$PWD/data":/var/lib/mysql --user 1000:1000 --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mysql:tag
